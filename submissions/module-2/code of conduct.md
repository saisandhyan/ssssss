TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at any Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a corresponding representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document. "Smart Trove" stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.


Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.


Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, community staff, and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.


If a participant engages in harassing behavior, community may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type.


If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the community  using the reporting procedures defined below. community  representatives will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.


We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues, online interactions in relation to the event, community-related social events, and on community supplied transportation.
